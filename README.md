# tt-installer
Install the tenstorrent software stack with one command.

## Quickstart
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-installer/releases/latest/download/install.sh)"
```
**WARNING:** Take care with this command! Always be careful running untrusted code.

## Using tt-metalium
In addition to our system-level tools, this script installs tt-metalium, Tenstorrent's framework for building and running AI models. Metalium is installed as a container using Podman. Using the container is easy- just run `tt-metalium`. By default, this will launch the container with your home directory mounted so you can access your files. You can also run `tt-metalium <command>` to run commands inside the container, such as `tt-metalium "python3"`.

For more about Metalium and TTNN, check out the [examples page](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-metal/latest/ttnn/ttnn/usage.html#basic-examples). For more information about the container, see [this page](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-installer/wiki/Using-the-tt%E2%80%90metalium-container) on the wiki.

## Using Python Tools
tt-installer installs two Python tools on your system:
1. tt-smi: Tenstorrent's System Management Interface
2. tt-flash: Utility to update your firmware

Running `tt-smi` launches the interface where you can see your hardware status and confirm the install worked properly.

## Full List of Functions
tt-installer performs the following actions on your system:
1. Using your package manager, installs base packages the software stack depends on
2. Configures a Python environment to install Python packages
3. Installs tenstorrent's Kernel-Mode Driver (KMD)
4. Installs tt-flash and updates your card's firmware
5. Configures HugePages, which are necessary for fast access to your Tenstorrent hardware
6. Installs tt-smi, our System Management Interface
7. Using your package manager, installs Podman
8. Installs tt-metalium as a Podman container and configures the tt-metalium script for convenient access to it

The installer will ask the user to make choices about Python environments and tt-metalium. If you wish to configure the installation more granularly, see [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage).

## Advanced Usage
The installer supports command-line arguments for customization. For a full list of available arguments and their environment variable equivalents, please see [this page](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-installer/wiki/Customizing-your-installation) on the wiki.
